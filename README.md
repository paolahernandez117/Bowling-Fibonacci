# Bowling-Fibonacci
The Bowling Pin program let's you input the number of rows you want the formation to be up to and then return the total number of pins up to that row. The Fibonacci program let's you input the number of numbers you want to see of the fibonacci sequence and then finds the even numbers up to that point. To finish, it adds the sum of those even numbers.
